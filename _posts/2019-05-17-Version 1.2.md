We are very excited to announce that version 1.2 of MetGem has just been released.

New features mainly include:
- **Mac OS X and Linux builds**
- You can now customize **pie charts colors** using a selection dialog:

- You can now create mappings between a metadata column and sizes of nodes:

- A switch button has been added to **temporarily disable pie charts**
- Added a '**lock view**' button above each view to prevent nodes to be moved by accident
- **Export function for metadata and databases results**
- Copy-paste function on graphs and metadata tables
- Add a new database source: [MSDial](http://prime.psc.riken.jp/Metabolomics_Software/MS-DIAL/)
- Use of OpenGL can now be disable using a command line switch (--disable-opengl) because, on some computers, this was leading to a blank window
- **Isolated nodes can now be hidden** in both views and a line has been added to separate isolated nodes from other in the t-SNE view

- Enhanced **Cytoscape export** (cosine scores are exported)
- Added support for NIST format (.msp) for input data or databases
- Added a plugin system for databases sources that allows to update the download functions without updating MetGem.

A few notes about this release:
- Naming scheme for databases has changed: **Delete the file spectra.sqlite in the user's folder/databases then download all DBs again**,
- To activate hide isolated nodes function for old projects on t-SNE view, please **redraw the t-SNE view**,
- Beware that views are now locked by default! Please **click on the lock button above each view to unlock the view**,

MetGem will be presented during the [12th scientific conference of the RFMF (*Réseau Français de Métabolomique et Fluxomique*)](https://12-js-rfmf-2019.sciencesconf.org/) to be held from May 21st to 23rd, 2019 in Clermont Ferrand (France).
A poster will be displayed during the 3 days of the conference and I will have the opportunity to explain a little bit how the software works during a Flash Communications (180s) on May 24th at 5:40pm.

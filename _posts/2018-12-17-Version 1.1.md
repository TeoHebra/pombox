We are very excited to announce that version 1.1 of MetGem has just been released.

We mainly improved databases query: this part have been re-written from scratch is now much faster while using less memory.
List of improvements also includes:
- Faster project loading.
- Faster generation of network graph.
- Spectra loaded in spectrum widget can now be saved as image or text.
- Maximum size of clusters can be controled in the network view with the `Maximum Connected Components Size` option.
- Improved User Interface, especially for downloading and querying databases.
- [In Silico MS/MS DataBase](http://oolonek.github.io/ISDB/) has been added to the databases available for download.

A large number of bugs have also been fixed. Full changelog can be found in the [release page](https://github.com/metgem/metgem/releases/tag/v1.1).
However, if you think you found one, feel free to fill a new issue on the [github project page](https://github.com/metgem/metgem/issues).

Please, note that we found unexpected behavior on MzMine versions newer than 2.32: MS/MS can sometimes be empty in exported MGF files. Please stay with [MZMine 2.32](https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine2/releases/tag/v2.32) until this problem has been fixed.

- Fix t-SNE line position if scale is changed,
- Node Size Combo icon is now an action that can be used to change node size,
- Set unsaved changes flag when using or deleting mappings,
- Don't reset node table headers after loading group mapping files,
- Add an explicit warning if user try to query database and no library has been downloaded yet,
